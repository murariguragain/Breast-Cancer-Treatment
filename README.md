## Breast-Cancer-Treatment
ðŸ©º Clinical Trial Data Management â€“ Breast Cancer Treatment

This project focuses on managing and analyzing clinical trial data for a small molecule drug targeting breast cancer. The goal is to evaluate drug efficacy, biosafety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology across thousands of patients recruited from multiple trial sites.

## Key Highlights:

Designed a data pipeline for patient health and pathological records (age, tumor size, histologic type/grade, lymph node status, biomarkers, metastasis).

Managed and structured data from placebo and treatment groups (low, medium, high dose; single vs repeated injection).

Enabled comparative analysis between treatment and placebo groups to determine drug impact on survival rates.

Supported double-blind study design with unique patient IDs, routine checkups, and longitudinal data tracking.

## Future Extensions:

Automate adverse event tracking and reporting to regulatory authorities.

Integrate genomic and biomarker data for deeper insights.

Apply ML models for survival prediction and treatment response analysis.
